# IS THE AMERICAN POLICE RACIST?


## Introduction

Racism is unfortunately a big part of our modern societies. Racism is defined as "prejudice, discrimination, or antagonism directed against a person or people on the basis of their membership of a particular racial or ethnic group, typically one that is a minority or marginalized".

Racism has permeated all sectors of life and affects the minority groups in different corners. This project is trying to prove the existence of racial injustice in the American Police System. The data used in this research contains information about victims of Fata Police Shootings in America from 2015 to 2020; this data was provided by Center for Disease Control (CDC) and The Federal Bureau of Intelligence (FBI) and downloaded from Kaggle.

This paper is focused on performing exploratory data analyzes to investigate and validate the existence of racial disparity in the use of lethal force by law enforcement officers toward Black or African Americans. The result of the analyzes shows evidence of racial disparity in the use of lethal force by police  that shows a higher proportion of African Americans killed by police officers compared to their white counterparts.

According to the National Population census report of 2019, there are 60.1% White, 18.5% Hispanic, 13.4% Black or African Americans, 5.9% Asians, 1.3% Native Americans, and 0.2%  other races in the United States.

From the fatal police shooting data, 51.2% white suspects and 26.5% black suspects were fatally shot by police across the country in the last five years.
Anyone looking at these numbers would argue that there is no evidence to believe that police officers are racially biased at the shooting of suspects, but digging deeper and comparing racial proportions, we see a clear proof of racial bias in police actions.
 
The question this research seeks to answer is; **Does racial disparity exist in community policing in America?**


## Conclusion

The analysis has shown that racial disparity exists in policing in America and that a Black man is 2.63 time more likely to get killed by a police officer than his white counterpart.
